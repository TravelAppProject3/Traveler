# Traveler

#### It is said that about **10% of the world population** travels every year. Traveling can occur in groups or by yourself. Our idea focuses on “yourself” or the solo travelers. Our idea is a web platform that enables solo travelers to keep track of their trips, see what else they can do while on their trips and then socialize with other solo travelers while doing so! The value proposition is when traveling, everything is seemingly in so many different places. Hotels, restaurants, events, socializing, it is all on a different website or inside a different application. We present to you a solution where it is all in one.
